	  Choose Y here if you want to allow SMB3 compliant clients
	  to access files residing on this system using SMB3 protocol.
	  To compile the SMB3 server support as a module,
	  choose M here: the module will be called ksmbd.

	  You may choose to use a samba server instead, in which
	  case you can choose N here.

	  You also need to install user space programs which can be found
	  in cifsd-tools, available from
	  https://github.com/cifsd-team/cifsd-tools.
	  More detail about how to run the cifsd kernel server is
	  available via README file
